# 🌊 Oceaniccoder — Personal Portfolio (v2)

A modern, elegant, and thoughtfully crafted developer portfolio built to showcase my work, values, and growth as a Software Engineer. This portfolio reflects my journey as a builder, leader, and community contributor — grounded in creativity, empathy, and purpose-driven innovation.

It evolves as I learn and ship more work.
