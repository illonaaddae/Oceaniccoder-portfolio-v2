    title: "Breaking Barriers: Women in Tech Leadership",
    excerpt:
      "Exploring the challenges and opportunities for women in technology leadership roles, and how we can create more inclusive environments.",
    content: `In a society where women are often underestimated, I am determined to shift the conversation. Technology is for everyone—gender, wealth, or background should never limit one's potential to innovate and succeed.

    Through my journey as the Executive Director of Slint Tech, I've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of inclusive leadership in technology. This post explores the barriers women face in tech leadership and practical strategies for creating more equitable opportunities.

    ## The Current Landscape

    Despite making up nearly half of the workforce, women hold only 25% of computing jobs and 20% of engineering positions. The statistics are even more stark in leadership roles, where representation drops significantly.

    ## Creating Change

    Change begins with recognition, continues with action, and succeeds through persistence. We must advocate for equal opportunities, support mentorship programs, and build communities that celebrate diversity.

    ## My Mission

    I believe in a world where opportunities are equal, dreams are boundless, and success is driven by determination, hard work, and talent—not defined by gender.`,
